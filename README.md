Global medical resources and related strict personnel with medical expertise have been in short supply. How to apply artificial intelligence technology to alleviate medical consulting problems has become a hot topic in the field of machine learning applications. In this report, we will describe how to use recurrent neural networks (RNNS) and pre-trained large models to complete the tasks of healthcare-related consultation chatbots. The whole approach is designed to cover a wider range of healthcare-related consultation questions with less feedback time and to output text information with more diverse and accurate medical knowledge. By constructing a time-series artificial neural network architecture, the medical chatbot can process text data more accurately, and optimize the efficiency and performance of the subsequent model for data processing by preprocessing and screening medical data. The whole chatbot is designed to independently extract relevant key information and judge corresponding diseases, treatment drugs, and other relevant useful information through the text type symptom description information provided by users and integrate this medical information into new structured text information to provide users with medical consultation.
